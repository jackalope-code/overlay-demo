# Realtime Networked Image Overlay
## Installation for development
### Requirements
- Requires Node.js https://nodejs.org/en
- Requires git https://git-scm.com/
- Visual Studio Code or a similar IDE with linting and integrated command line terminals recommended.
- I'm going to Dockerize this at some point but Docker is not required for this to work.
- Something like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) can be used to inspect HTTP and WebSocket requests/responses from a GUI.

Uses React and the npm express package, among other npm dependencies.

Clone the repo from the command line:  
```git clone https://github.com/jackalope-code/stream-overlay```  


### Starting the API server for the first time
From the command line:  
1. `cd` into the cloned repo server directory (stream-overlay)
2. `cd server`
3. Install dependencies  
`npm install`
4. Start the node server with live reloading on code changes (defaults to http://localhost:4000)  
`npm run dev`

### Starting the webpage for the first time
From the command line:
1. `cd` into the cloned repo directory (stream-overlay)
2. Install dependencies  
`npm install`
3. Start the create-react-app development server with live reloading at http://localhost:3000

Running `npm run dev` from the server directory and `npm start` from the root stream-overlay directory is enough to start the API server and the webpage respectively, once npm dependencies are installed.

Once the app is deployed, the API will run on a remote server and the webpage interfaces with the API. The users interface with the app from the browser and no dependencies are required for users at that point.

## Local testing
- Start the development servers for the API and the webpage
- Open two browser windows to the url http://localhost:3000
- Updates to one window should be mirrored to the other window

## Issues
Movement is totally bugged right now
